# Welcome to Render-Hell!  
A Unity project designed to test my HLSL skills and your GPU’s patience.

Here, I throw shaders at your screen that will make your graphics card question its life choices... think of it as a chaotic playground for graphics enthusiasts where lighting, textures, and post-processing effects all come together to create beautiful, unpredictable mayhem.

If you're brave enough, dive in... just don’t say I didn’t warn you.
