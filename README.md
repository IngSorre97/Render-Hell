## What is Render Hell?

A Unity project designed to test my HLSL skills and your GPUâ€™s patience.

Here, I throw shaders at your screen that will make your graphics card question its life choices... think of it as a chaotic playground for graphics enthusiasts where lighting, textures, and post-processing effects all come together to create beautiful, unpredictable mayhem.

If you're brave enough, dive in... just donâ€™t say I didnâ€™t warn you.

## Brush3D

Brush3D is a tool designed for intuitive and interactive manipulation of 3D meshes within Unity, allowing users to paint colors directly onto mesh surfaces.

Brush3D has different modes that can work on:
- Intersecting:  
Colored preview of cursor sphere on the mesh

- Drawing:  
Leave a persistent color on the mesh, useful to mark particular 3D sections

- Clipping:  
Hide certain parts of the mesh, useful to clean a chaotic mesh or to highlight other parts

### *And who knows what the future may have in store for us...*
